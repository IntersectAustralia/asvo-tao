Summary and Submit
===================

The final step shows a summary of the selected catalogue paramters. It also gives the user the chance to add a catalogue description.

The double arrows (>>) can be used to expand the summary to provide mode detail.

A job will not submit if there are errors. The user can check any errors by following the "click to see errors" link.
