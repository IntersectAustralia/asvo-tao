Selection (Data Filter)
=======================

TAO encourages the user to put at maximum one filter over the selected data to minimize the output size. The selection step is mandatory. The user is required to select a global data selection using one of the output fields ( one is selected by default). The user can select to add a lower bound one, an upper bound only, or both.

Output Format
=============
TAO supports four output formats for the output of the Light-cone and SED modules. These formats are:

* CSV
* FITS
* HDF5
* VOTable (XML)

Please note that the Mock Image module output format is selected within the Mock Image module form.

If you would like to view the data and perform general visualisations the VOTable and FITS format files can be read by `TOPCAT <http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/>`_

If you need to write some code to do more detailed analysis, sample scripts demonstrating how to access the data are avilable in the :ref:`script-lib`.
