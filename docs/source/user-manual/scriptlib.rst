The script archive below demonstrates how to access the mock catalogues generated by TAO.  The scripts are not intended to be useful as they stand (they simply print the file contents in space separated format), but as a starting point to assist you develop programs to further analyse the results.

| File formats: FITS, HDF5, VOTable
| Languages: C/C++, Fortran 90, Python
