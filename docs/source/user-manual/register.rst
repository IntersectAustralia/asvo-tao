**Why registration is required**


Many astronomical datasets are freely available to download from the web in their raw form without the need for an account. 
However, TAO is different in that both datasets of significance and value-adding eResearch tools are being coupled online and made available to the community. 
Such tools require high performance computing to process (such as Swinburne Universityâ€™s supercomputer, gSTAR), and these resources are expensive to install and maintain. 
Hence, to ensure that they are not wasted or abused, and to help us continually optimise the system, we are requiring all users of TAO to be registered. 
Anyone with a legitimate association with the Astronomy community will be granted an account. The login and registration forms are accessible from the home page as shown in the figure above. 

**TAO supports two methods of authentication:**
