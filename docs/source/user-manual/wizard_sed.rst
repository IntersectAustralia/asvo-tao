Spectral Energy Distribution
============================

By default, the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) module is disabled. If you would like apparent or absolute magnitudes, in addition to the output properties chosen in the previous tab, enable it by checking the box.

In order to apply the SED module, the user needs to select:

* Single stellar population model 
* Output Magnitudes (Band pass filters)
* Dust model (optional)

As before, information about a selection is given in the right panel (1). Filter selections can be made by adding them to your selection list (2). A dust model can be applied from a drop-down list (3).
