TAO User's Guide

Home page of user's guide.

A number of guiding principles and assumptions have been adopted in the design of TAO:

* The system should be as simple as possible to use, while delivering the required functionality.  In particular, knowledge of SQL is not required.
* The user will need to do further filtering and refinement of the data on their local system.

Each dataset is available as a mini- and full- version.

To get the best value from TAO it is recommended that you follow the high level process outlined below (or tell us a better way so we can improve TAO).

#. Develop your query using the mini- version of the Dataset
#. After confirming that the query is returning the required data (output properties, bandpass filters, etc.), re-run the query of the full Dataset.
