Output Formats
==============

TAO currently supports the following file formats for writing out mock catalogues:

* CSV (Text)
* HDF5
* VOTable
* FITS

If you would like to view the data and perform general visualisations the VOTable and FITS format files can be read by `TOPCAT <http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/>`_

If you need to write some code to do more detailed analysis, sample scripts demonstrating how to access the data are avilable in the :ref:`script-lib`.
