Mock Image
==========

Before the Mock Image module can be selected the user must have chosen a light-cone geometry in the General Properties tab and selected at least one filter in the SED module. The Mock Image module uses the `SkyMaker <http://www.astromatic.net/software/skymaker>`_ image generation package. If the user has selected more than one light-cone then images with different parameters for each selected cone can be made at the same time.
