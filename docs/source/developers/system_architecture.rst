TAO Hardware and Database Architecture

   :alt: Main system hardware design


Design Assumptions
------------------

- In order to support `VO Table Access Protocol (TAP) <http://www.ivoa.net/documents/TAP/>`_, the ability to support executing direct SQL query to the database (the simulation data) is a mandatory requirment. This limit the ability to use No-SQL Databases and HADOOP-like processing architecture.
- Efficient handling of large datasets is the main challenge for the TAO project. In this context, the ability to query and access the underlying datasets is the systemâ€™s main performance bottleneck.
- Using a commercial version of a distributed Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) will limit further adoptability of the system in an open source enviroment and add a significant burden on the system main budget.


Design Decisions
----------------

- Using a distributed (cluster) database solution is preferred over the single node DBMS. Using cluster DBMS will speed-up different data access processes, and support better system scalability to more and bigger datasets.
- The current hardware architecture is partitioned into three main servers and the `SwinSTAR Supercomputer <http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/supercomputing/green2/>`_ with the following specifications:
  
  * One low-end Web-Server (Node A in figure 1)
  * Two identical medium class application/database-servers (Node B and C in figure 1)
  
The functionality and details of these nodes will be discussed in details in the next section.
