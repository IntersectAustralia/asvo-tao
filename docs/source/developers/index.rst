Developer's guide

This is currently more of a dumping ground than an organised guide - it should improve
over time.

=============
Galaxy Models
=============

Galaxy Models may be thought of as having three types of input properties:

# Required: The model won't run without these properties being present
# Optional: The model will produce additional information if these properties are present
# Propagated: These properties are simply passed through and written to the output

SAGE doesn't follow this model yet, but it is planned for the future.
