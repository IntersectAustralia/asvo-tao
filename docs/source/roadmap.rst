Roadmap
==========

We have the current development roadmap for TAO:

* Add in more simulations and models.
* Develop simulation and model import tools.
* Refine image module options to make images easier to generate and more realistic.
* Add the ability to created images from the history tab without having to re-run the whole job.
* Add auto-generated acknowledgements to summary.txt.
* Add the ability to limit a cone by apparent magnitude.
* Change cone option: opening angle -> min/max RA and DEC for realistic sky coverage.
* Add the ability to output multiple snapshots for a box geometry.
* Allow the user to specify their preferred H0, where appropriate.
* Allow the user to retrieve the the full progenitor history for selected galaxy/halo properties.
* Expand the TAP functionality.

We welcome feedback and suggestions. Please contact us through the `TAO support page </tao/accounts/support_page/>`_
