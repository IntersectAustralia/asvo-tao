Multiple unique light cones have the same observation point
-----------------------------------------------------------

When generating multiple unique light cones the same observation point is used for all of the catalogues, resulting in the same cone being generated.  A different observation point should be selected for each cone to ensure that no part of the simulation space is used in multiple light-cones.


Number of light cones widget
----------------------------

The counter widget for selecting the number of light cones  is inconsistent in its behaviour, sometimes changing value when the mouse is moved over the counter buttons, and displaying warnings at unexpected times.
