    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
	<p>The Theoretical Astrophysical Observatory (TAO) houses queryable 
	data from multiple popular cosmological simulations and galaxy formation 
	models. Your results can be funnelled through higher-level modules for 
	additional enhancements and manipulation. TAO is accessible from anywhere 
	you can access the internet.</p>

	<p>If you haven't done so already, please register to use TAO. Under the 
	hood, TAO is driven by the gSTAR supercomputer at the Swinburne University 
	of Technology. Registering allows us to most efficiently manage the 
	resources that TAO relies on.</p>

	<p>If you are new to the world of Theoretical Astrophysical Observatories, 
	please read our <a href="static/docs/project/index.html">Introduction</a>. 
	In particular, you might want to browse our 
	<a href="static/docs/user-manual/index.html">User's Guide</a> and 
	<a href="static/docs/user-manual/overview.html">System Overview</a> 
	to learn about TAO's capabilities and how to get the best value from the system.</p>

	<p>If you're ready to build a mock universe, go ahead and generate a new 
	catalogue.</p> 

	<p>You can always access your past catalogues from the history tab.</p>

	<p>BETA ALERT! TAO is currently in public beta and is undergoing rapid 
	development. Right now not everything is stable or finished. 
	Please report any unexpected behaviour or bugs so we can fix them. 
	And always check that the data you downloaded is the data you expected 
	before using it. All feedback and comments should be sent through our 
	support form for the quickest possible response.</p>
